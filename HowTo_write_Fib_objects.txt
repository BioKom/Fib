HowTo: Write "manually" Fib objects
===================================

Here are a few tips for all who want to write Fib objects "by hand" in XML
with an text editor the first time.

With a few tools, you can make the writing of XML easier

This  includes an editor that is designed for XML (e. g. Windows Notepad++
from http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ or Linux Quanta). With commands such
as can "xmllint" under Linux, you can check the created XML file for simple
XML errors.

Unfortunately, there is no XSD file for Fib at the moment.


Convert Fib objects to images
-----------------------------

With the program "convertFromFib" in the folder "add_ons/converter/bin/"
Fib objects can be converted into the image they represent.
More info about it in the "add_ons/converter/bin/readme.txt" file.
To see how these program can be generated, see "readme.txt" (in the current
directory).

If you have created (make) the converters with the switches
DEBUG_RESTORE_XML and DEBUG_EVALUE enabled (see "fib/version.h"), the
converter will give you some hints for debugging your Fib objects.


Examples for correct Fib objects
--------------------------------

A good source for the "copy & past" creating of Fib objects or examples of
correct Fib objects can be found in the  subdirectory of "fib/testObjects/".
The file "fib/testObjects/testWithEvalue.txt" lists the directories and
file names (+ ".xml" in the same directory) of correct Fib XML objects.


Fib database
------------

A other source of correct Fib objects is the Fib database.

The in the Fib database contained Fib objects can be used in other objects,
with the help of there identifier and the Fib exteral object element (obj).
With the help of the database objects, you can create easiely complex
multimedia objects.
