nConvertToFib
=============

This folder contains the namespace for function and classes that are for
converting non Fib image data into Fib structures.

The normal method (for the strategies see this folder) is to search
(@see nSearchForStructur) in the image for image structures
(@see nStructureData) and convert them into Fib objects
(@see nStructureData/nConvertToFib).
To adapt the found image structures operators (@see subfolder
nStructureData/nOperators/ )on them can be used.
