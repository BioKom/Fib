tFibNodeHandler_integrateFibObjectIntoNode testcases:
	- change below Fib node Fib element
		-- one branch changed

- main window
-- try to implement sub windows for the different Fib object views
-- icons: (into /images/icon/) iconNew.png iconOpen.png iconSaveAs.png
	(iconCut.png iconCopy.png iconPaste.png)


- database functions:
	- load database object
	- get database objects from database directory / source
	- set database folder (+ recursive)
	- store as database object into database

- object view (for database objects)
-- connections betwean objects

- draw background ( paint() ) correctly (cEvalueSimpleRGBA255QPainter)

- Bugfix?: cFibInputVariables(0x1a2b888)::assignValues() called very often

- build cFibElement elements for creator, e.g. cArea -> cAreaCreator
-- implement converter from cFib* to cFib*Creator (cFib*Creator constructor + convert equal to copyElement() )
-- implement partial store and restore (with tickets)
--- basis version in cFibElement (returning with ticket befor reading the next Fib element)
-- implement cFibInputVariable connection
-- implement view for them


nice to have:
-------------

- cFibNodeHandler: implement SWITCH_SUPERIOR_EVALUED_OBJECT


eFibNodeChangedEvent::fibNodeChangedEvent():
	 * adapt the changes from the given node into event and fast forward the version number to that of the other node.


cFibObjectSourcePath::loadFibObject() : "user can change" adapt for operating system users or/and with optional part entry

cFibObjectInfoHandler:
	- load Fib object infos given with installation (give Fib object infos for DB objects with installation)

cFibObjectInfo + tFibObjectInfo: extractInfoFromLoadedFibObject() ( + cFibObjectInfo( ulInIdentifier, pInFibObjectSource ) )

cWidgetFibObjectInfo:
	- description Text if mouse click -> select info
	- picture for is changebel
	- create and add mini pictures (for bottom line)


- test drawing on areas greater +-2^15 (QPainter restrictions)


cFlowLayout::heightForWidth( const int iWidth ):
	- use caching (use same value as long as nothing is changed in layout)
