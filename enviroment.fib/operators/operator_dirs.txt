# Every line with an '#' as the first character will be ignored, it is an
# comment line. Every line with no '#' as the first character, should just
# contain the path of a directiory with operators and no other characters
# (this means also no blanks or else except the ending new line character).
# The path should be given relativ to the fib/enviroment.fib/operators/ path.
# The directory of the path should contain two subdirectories "incl/" and
# "src/". The "incl/" directory should contain the header files, with
# headers of the operators. The names of the files in the "incl/"
# directory, without the ending ".h", will be taken as the possible operator
# names. The "src/" directory, in the same directory as the "incl/"
# directory, should contain the implemntations of the operators of the 
# "incl/" directory.
